# IP Whitelist Configuration
# IPs that should bypass the blocklist (legitimate users, admins, monitoring services)

# Format: allow IP_ADDRESS;

# Example: Uncomment to whitelist your IP
# allow 27.71.207.58;

# Example: Uncomment to whitelist a specific subnet
# allow 192.168.1.0/24;

# Example: Whitelist monitoring services
